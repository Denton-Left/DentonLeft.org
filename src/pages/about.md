The Denton Left is an organization of communists, socialists, and anarchists that seek to unify the anti-capitalist ideologies of Denton into a single force.

We believe that capitalism is a destructive and outdated economic model. We seek to usher in a new system based on the needs of the people in that system.

Below you can find our Foundational Principles. These are the ideological tenets of our organization.

•    Denton Left is a revolutionary, anti-capitalist organization.
•    We believe in extending democracy into the workplace. Workers should be in control of the means of production.
•    We believe food, housing, health care, and education are human rights.
•    We are a feminist, anti-racist, pro-immigrant, and pro-LGBT+ organization.
•    We are anti-imperialist. We believe US intervention does more harm than good.
•    We believe workers have the right to self-defense. 
•    We are abolitionists who believe in building strong communities committed to transformative justice rather than relying on police. 
•    We do not police gender. Gender affirming health care is a right. Trans, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people deserve full access to society.
•    We believe in free abortion on demand, free childcare, and the ability for all children to grow up free from the threat of violence.
•    We believe addiction is a health issue rather than a legal issue. Treatment should be freely available but not forced.
•    We believe in disability rights. Society should be universally accessible.
•    We believe Black lives matter. In addition to abolishing the police, we believe in reparations and amplifying Black voices in the community. 
•    We believe that crossing imagined borders is not a crime. Immigrants deserve full amnesty.
•    We believe in the decolonization of the United States. This entails self-determination for Indigenous people as well as a return of land.

In addition to these principles we also believe that Denton has its own needs separate from the DFW Metroplex and support our city's political autonomy. We also uphold that we cannot make any significant change in Denton without unifying, otherwise we would be dividing up resources for similar goals.
